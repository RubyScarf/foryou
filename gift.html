    <h1>This Holiday Season...</h1>
    <p> Hey beautiful! You know, I really love the holidays, particularly this one. I love the festivities that come with it and the warm 
        and delicious food that comes with it. In my culture, we do a whole bunch of things. But I've not been able to really participate 
        in any. The last couple Christmas', it's been spent with my brothers and mother. No one else. But this Christmas, I'm excited to 
        spend it with you, even the smallest bit. That's all I need in life. <br><br>

        Now, I don't know what Christmas is like in Japan. Heck, it's not even a national holiday, ey? But I am hoping to share some of the 
        holiday spirit with you. To bring some of the joy that comes with it to you. <br><br>
