                Beautiful, <br>
                         Hi, tis Christmas Day! You made it! Google said that in Japan, Christmas isn't really a big thing, not very well 
                        celebrated, not even a national holiday. Heck, it just says people eat KFC on this day so it is like National KFC Day 
                        or smth? idek :D But for me, Christmas is the coolest, most joyful, and fun holiday, and I wanted to share that
                        with you. I've never made a fully blown html code made for people to return to. I took ONE coding class and even then 
                        I was not great at coding. But I REALLY wanted to do something cool. I spent all of November figuring this out; first: what 
                        I wanted to do; second: how to do it; third: customize it and make it cool. I did not code the entirety from scratch, I 
                        looked these templates up then added all the content myself. More and more ideas came up. I was only going to do one page, this one, Day 25. Then I got 
                        the idea to make a whole advent calendar. By that time, I had 1.5 weeks to finish it. But I was committed, I wanted to do 
                        it so bad because I thought it would be cool. Here we are. I sent it, it worked? -I think. I literally already sent it abd im STILL adding minor things.<br>
                            To be honest, I did not know what to gift you at all. I did not know what to put in this page. I drew the image above 
                            on the first week I planned to do any of this, but it didn't feel like enough. I tried searching up what I could do, 
                            but most were domestic things. I felt like stuck. But idk, i figured writing something would be the best I could do.
                            Tell you my thought process on this entire thing. I mean I learned quite some stuff. Whether I'll use it in the future 
                            is a different question but 'oh well!' <br>
                                Anywho, I'm just entirely happy, filled with joy, ecstatic having you in my life. 
            </p>
