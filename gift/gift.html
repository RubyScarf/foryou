                Beautiful,
Hi, t'is Christmas Day! You made it! Google said that in Japan, Christmas isn't really a big thing, it's not very well 
celebrated, and it's not even a national holiday. Heck, it just says people eat KFC on this day so it is like the National 
KFC Day in Japan or smth? idek :D. But Christmas is <em>my</em> favorite holiday. It's the most meaningful, most magical, joyful, and fun 
holiday to me; I wanted to share that with you. <br><br>
To be honest, I did not know what to gift you at all. That's why I asked you. I did not know what to put in this page. 
I drew the image above on the first week I planned to do any of this, but it didn't feel like it was enough. I tried 
searching for what I could do, but most were domestic things. I felt stuck. But idk, I figured writing something would 
be the best I could do. Then I remembered I could somewhat code. I'm still writing you something. Telling you my thought 
process on this entire thing. I mean I learned quite some stuff. Whether I'll use it in the future is a different question 
but 'oh well!' It was fun- because it was for you. <br><br>
I've never made a full-blown HTML code for people to return to. Not like this. I took ONE coding class 2 years ago and even 
then, I was not really that great at it. But one thing was clear: I <strong>REALLY</strong> wanted to do something cool 
for you. I spent all of November figuring this out; first: what I wanted to do; second: how I was going to make it; third: 
how to customize it and make it amazing. I did not quite code the entirety from scratch, I looked these templates up, they were 
so bland and boring so I made it look nicer and added all the content myself. In doing that, more and more ideas came up. I was only going to do 
one page, this one, Day 25. Then I got the idea to make a whole advent calendar. By that time, I only had 2 weeks to finish it and I knew the trip was coming up too. 
But I was committed, I wanted to do it so bad because I thought it would be cool and to me, you're so worth it. Now here 
we are. I sent it, and it worked?! -I think. I literally already sent it and I'm STILL adding minor things. I just want it 
to be incredible (ideally perfect but I ain't got a clue how to do that).<br><br>

Anywho, I'm just entirely happy, filled with joy, ecstatic having you in my life. This Christmas season, I've made it my 
goal to make your experience superb. Idk how I'll ever match up to this again. Will I need to learn JavaScript next? LOL!
I truly hope you enjoyed this whole thing. I hope you had fun with the puzzles, the videos, and the stories. idk if it's 
wrong to bring God into this, but I pray He is always watching and protecting you. <br><br> 
You mean so much to me Yuri. <br>
You deserve the whole world. I don't quite think I can give it to you, but I sure wanna ride along with you. 
            <p style="text-align: right"> 
                Always wishing you the Best, <br> Susan Gonzalez
