                Beautiful, <br><br>
Hi, t'is Christmas Day! You made it! Google said that in Japan, Christmas isn't really a big thing, it's not very well 
celebrated, and it's not even a national holiday. Heck, it just says people eat KFC on this day so it is like the National 
KFC Day or smth? idek :D. But for me, Christmas is the most meaningful, most magical, joyful, and fun holiday; I
wanted to share that with you. <br><br>
I've never made a full-blown HTML code for people to return to. Not like this. I took 
ONE coding class and even then, I was not great at coding. But I <strong><em>REALLY</em></strong> wanted to do something 
cool. I spent all of November figuring this out; first: what I wanted to do; second: how I was going to make it; third: 
customize it and make it amazing. I did not quite code the entirety from scratch, I looked these templates up, they were 
so bland so I made it look nicer and added all the content myself. More and more ideas came up. I was only going to do 
one page, this one, Day 25. Then I got the idea to make a whole advent calendar. By that time, I had 2 weeks to finish it. 
But I was committed, I wanted to do it so bad because I thought it would be cool and to me, you're so worth it. Now here 
we are. I sent it, and it worked?! -I think. I literally already sent it and I'm STILL adding minor things. I just want it 
to be incredible (ideally perfect but I ain't got a clue how to do that).<br><br>
To be honest, I did not know what to gift you at all. That's why I asked you. I did not know what to put in this page. 
I drew the image above on the first week I planned to do any of this, but it didn't feel like it was enough. I tried 
searching for what I could do, but most were domestic things. I felt stuck. But idk, I figured writing something would 
be the best I could do. Tell you my thought process on this entire thing. I mean I learned quite some stuff. Whether I'll 
use it in the future is a different question but 'oh well!' It was fun- because it was for you. <br><br>
Anywho, I'm just entirely happy, filled with joy, ecstatic having you in my life. This Christmas season, I've made it my 
goal to make your experience superb. Idk how I'll ever match up to this again. Will I need to learn JavaScript next? LOL!
I truly hope you enjoyed this whole thing. I hope you had fun with the puzzles, the videos, and the stories. idk if it's 
wrong to bring in God to this, but I pray He is always watching and protecting you. <br><br> 
You mean the world to me Yuri. <br>
You deserve the whole world. I don't quite think I can give it to you, but I sure wanna ride along with you.
