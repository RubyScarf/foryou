                Beautiful, <br><br>
Hi, t'is Christmas Day! You made it! Google said that in Japan, Christmas isn't really a big thing, it's not very well 
celebrated, and it's not even a national holiday. Heck, it just says people eat KFC on this day so it is like the National 
KFC Day in Japan or smth? idek :D. But Christmas is <em>my</em> favorite holiday. It's the most meaningful, most magical, joyful, and fun 
holiday to me; I wanted to share that with you. <br><br>
To be honest, I did not know what to gift you at all. That's why I asked you. I did not know what to put on this page. 
I drew the image above on the first week I planned to do any of this, but it didn't feel like it was enough. I tried 
searching for what I could do, but most were domestic things. I felt stuck. But idk, I figured writing something would 
be the best I could do. Then I remembered I could somewhat code. Technically I'm still writing you <em>something</em>. A 
whole lot of something, this whole repository. I made one for Bryce too, but I didn't put as much effort into it as I did 
this one. His is only 24 days and it's kinda basic. The point is I put a ton of effort into this gift. <br><br>
I figured I'd also tell you my thought process on this entire thing. It changed a lot. But it was fun- because it was for 
you. I also learned a lot, whether or not I'll ever use it is another question but um- "oh well!" I've never made a full-blown 
HTML code for people to return to. Not like this. I took ONE coding class 2 years ago and even 
then, I was not really that great at it. But I had one thing clear: I <strong>REALLY</strong> wanted to do something cool 
for you. I spent all of November figuring this out; first: what I wanted to do; second: how I was going to make it; third: 
how to customize it and make it amazing. I did not quite code the entirety from scratch, I looked up the advent calendar page and all the JavaScript stuff. It was 
so bland and boring so I had to make it look nicer. Luckily I kinda understand HTML and CSS so I fixed that and I added all 
the content myself, all hand-selected for you. In doing that, more and more ideas came up. I was only going to do 
one page, the one right before this one, Day 25. I wanted to make a gift page so I added this one. Then, I got the idea to 
make a whole advent calendar. By that time, I only had 2 weeks to finish it and I knew the trip was coming up too. 
But I was committed, I wanted to do it so bad because I thought it would be cool and to me, you're so worth it. Now here 
we are. I sent it, and it worked?! -I think. I literally already sent it and I'm STILL adding minor things. I just want it 
to be incredible (ideally perfect but I ain't got a clue how to do that).<br><br>
Anywho, I'm just entirely happy, filled with joy, ecstatic having you in my life. This Christmas season, I made it my 
goal to make your experience superb. I hope I was successful. Idk how I'll ever match up to this again. Will I need to learn JavaScript next? LOL!
I truly hope you enjoyed this whole thing. I hope you had fun with the puzzles, the videos, and the stories. I hope I was able to distract you from the bad things in life. 
You mean so much to me Yuri. I wish I could give you the world. I don't quite think I can do that, but I sure wanna ride 
along with you on the journey. I love you so darn much. <br>
idk if it's wrong to bring God into this, but I pray He is always watching and protecting you.

                Always wishing you the Best, <br> Susan G. Gonzalez M.
