            Every Christmas, the Navarros get excited about one of Grandma's special culinary dishes. She keeps all the recipes from everyone. 

But grandma's not feeling great so she couldn't make any dish. So she sends them on a fun quest to get the recipe for one dish, in particular, Amy's favorite.
