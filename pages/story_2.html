            <br>Old McGraw was planning his vacation to the Bahamas out on his porch. He really despises the cold, so ever winter, he is like a birdie, migrating to a warmer climate. 
            McGraw is so ready for his trip, but his plans were delayed for a couple days since his neighbors got stranded and required assistance in taking care of their pets for a bit. The sitter was not willing to do more. Feeling bad for them and loving those two gremlins, he agrees.
            The departure day approached, and Old McGraw was reviewing his checklist, ensuring he had everything he needed. At this point, McGraw was an expert. 
            “Tickets? Check. Passport? Check. Sandals and sunscreen? Double check,” he muttered to himself with a satisfied smirk. He was excited, soon he’d be soaking in the warm Bahamian sun, far away from the snow and cold he detested.
            
            McGraw mentally pictured himself lazily lying on the beach. But outta no where, a loud <em>thud</em> interrupted his thoughts. He approaches his window and looks over the edge of the porch to see…a reindeer, no bigger than a large dog like his neighbor’s, pawing at the snow. Its antlers were uneven, one of them chipped, and its big, sorrowful eyes locked onto his.
            
            “What in the w-?” McGraw frowned, setting his checklist down. He walked outside, letting the door shut behind him. “Shoo! Get outta here!”
            
            The reindeer didn’t budge. Instead, it let out a low grunt and climbed awkwardly up the porch steps. The reindeer seemed desperate and as if it had decided McGraw, was its last hope.
            
            “Oh, no you don’t. I’m not getting mixed up in whatever mess you’ve got going on,” McGraw grumbled. “I’ve got a plane to catch tomorrow. Bahamas, sunshine, no snow. You hear me?”
            
            The reindeer tilted its head, as if unimpressed by his protest. Then, it lied down onto the porch with a dramatic sigh, “bgrrr.”
            
            “Oh, for crying out loud.” McGraw rubbed his temples. “Fine. You can stay here tonight. But come morning, I’m dropping you off at the animal shelter. Deal?”
            
            The reindeer blinked at him, its nose twitching, and McGraw could’ve sworn it almost smiled, as if he understood (like Kristoff).
            
            The next day, as McGraw loaded his luggage into the truck, the reindeer followed after him, patting its nose against his arm.
            
            “Nope, you’re not coming with me,” McGraw said firmly.
            
            But when he climbed into the driver’s seat and started the engine, the reindeer scrambled into the truck bed and refused to move. 
            
            McGraw threw his hands in the air in frustration. “You’ve got to be kidding me!”
            
            McGraw began throwing hands, but the reindeer didn’t seem to be bother. McGraw was forced to give in. He was determined not to miss his flight over some stubborn animal. “Fine. I’ll figure out what to do with you when we get to the airport.” 
            
            But as the journey continued, strange things began to happen. The snowstorm that had been forecasted didn’t materialize, and the roads were clearer than they’d been in weeks. A flat tire he’d worried about held strong. And every time he glanced in the rearview mirror, the reindeer stared back at him with an expression that felt…almost knowing.
            
            It wasn’t until he reached the airport parking lot that McGraw realized his plans were about to take a wild detour.
            
            
            
            
            As McGraw followed the reindeer out of the airport, he couldn’t shake the feeling that this creature had some kind of plan for him. The snow was falling lightly now, blanketing the streets in a quiet, magical glow.
            
            “Alright, you’ve dragged me this far,” McGraw muttered. “What next? You want me to pull a sleigh or something?”
            
            The reindeer stopped in front of a small park. There, in the clearing, stood the strangest sight McGraw had ever seen: an old, rickety sleigh with chipped red paint, piled high with what looked like burlap sacks.
            
            “Holy crap, FOR REAL? Oh, come on,” McGraw said. “This has got to be some kind of prank. Ain’t no way! Is there a camera crew hiding in the bushes?”
            
            The reindeer snorted and nudged him toward the sleigh. As McGraw hesitantly stepped closer, the faint jingling sound returned, growing louder. The air shimmered, and before his eyes, the sleigh seemed to repair itself—paint gleamed, the wood straightened, and the sacks transformed into perfectly wrapped gifts.
            
            McGraw stumbled back, rubbing his eyes. “Nope. Nope, nope, nope. This isn’t happening.”
            
            But the reindeer wasn’t giving up. It grabbed McGraw’s jacket sleeve with its teeth and tugged him toward the sleigh.
            
            “Alright, fine!” McGraw snapped, climbing into the seat. “But I’m not delivering anything. I’m too old for this nonsense.”
            
            As soon as he sat down, the reins appeared in his hands, and the reindeer leapt to the front, joined by several others that seemed to materialize out of thin air.
            
            “What is going on?” McGraw shouted.
            
            Suddenly, a booming voice echoed around him.
            
            “McGraw, you’ve been chosen,” it said. “For years, you’ve run from the cold, from the season, from the magic. But now, it’s your turn to step up.”
            
            “Step up?” McGraw barked. “I didn’t sign up for anything!”
            
            The voice chuckled warmly. “Magic chooses who it will. Tonight, you’ll take my place. Deliver the gifts, spread the joy. And perhaps, McGraw, you’ll find something you’ve been missing.”
            
            Before McGraw could protest, the sleigh jerked forward, the reindeer taking off into the sky.
            
            “Whoa! Slow down!” he yelled, clutching the sides of the sleigh. Below him, the town spread out like a snow globe, lights twinkling in every window.
            
            The first stop was a modest house on the edge of town. The sleigh landed softly on the roof, and McGraw found himself holding a sack of gifts.
            
            “You’ve got to be kidding me,” he muttered.
            
            But something about the glow of the house—something about the thought of the kids inside, waiting for Christmas morning—made him climb out of the sleigh. A ladder appeared at his side, and he slid down, landing softly in the living room.
            
            For the first time in years, McGraw felt a spark of something he couldn’t quite name. Joy? Wonder? Maybe both.
            
            As the night goes on, McGraw grows into his new role, visiting homes and spreading cheer. By the end, he returns to the sleigh, no longer grumbling but smiling—a true Santa at heart.
            
            The last house on McGraw’s route was tucked at the edge of the forest, small and humble. Snow piled high on the roof, and the glow of a single candle flickered in the window. McGraw guided the sleigh down, landing gently in the clearing.
            
            As he stepped out and hoisted the final sack of gifts onto his shoulder, he felt a strange warmth in his chest. He wasn’t sure if it was from the magic or the satisfaction of seeing the joy he’d brought to others that night. Either way, it felt…right.
            
            When McGraw slid down the chimney (the magic made it surprisingly easy), he landed in a cozy living room where a young boy sat by the fireplace, clutching a worn teddy bear.
            
            The boy’s eyes widened when he saw McGraw. “Santa?” he whispered.
            
            McGraw froze, unsure what to say. Then, as if on instinct, he gave the boy a small, warm smile. “That’s right, kid. You’ve been good this year, haven’t you?”
            
            The boy nodded eagerly. “I tried! I even helped Mom bake cookies!”
            
            McGraw chuckled. “Well, that deserves something special.” He reached into the sack and pulled out a shiny red fire truck, placing it gently in the boy’s hands.
            
            The boy beamed. “Thank you, Santa!”
            
            McGraw tousled the boy’s hair, then whispered, “Merry Christmas,” before climbing back up the chimney.
            
            As the sleigh soared into the sky for the final time that night, McGraw leaned back in his seat, letting out a contented sigh. The reindeer seemed to sense his change in mood, glancing back at him with what looked like approval.
            
            When the sleigh finally touched down at the park where it had all begun, McGraw expected the magic to vanish, for the sleigh and reindeer to disappear. But instead, the booming voice from before returned.
            
            “Well done, McGraw,” it said. “You’ve done more than deliver gifts tonight. You’ve rediscovered what it means to believe—in the season, in the magic, and in yourself.”
            
            McGraw chuckled, shaking his head. “You know, I didn’t think I had it in me.”
            
            The voice laughed warmly. “Oh, you’ve always had it in you. The cold never bothered you as much as you thought—it was just an excuse to avoid what scared you. Connection. Joy. Hope.”
            
            McGraw stared up at the stars, silent for a long moment. “What happens now?”
            
            “Now,” the voice said, “you rest. But the magic is always with you, McGraw. Whenever you choose to use it.”
            
            The sleigh and reindeer began to shimmer, fading into the night. When they were gone, McGraw found himself standing alone in the park, the sack of gifts replaced by a simple red coat trimmed with white fur. He slipped it on, feeling its warmth.
            
            As he walked back to his truck, the snow began to fall again, soft and steady. For the first time in years, McGraw didn’t mind the cold.
            
            And when he returned home that morning, just as the sun began to rise, he set a steaming mug of cocoa on his porch and watched the neighborhood children rush out to see what Santa had left them.
            
            He couldn’t help but smile.
            
            “Merry Christmas,” he whispered, more to himself than anyone else.
